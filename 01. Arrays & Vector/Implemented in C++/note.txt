-------------Array--------------
An array is a collection of elements of the same type placed in contigous memory locations.

-------------Vector (Dynamic Array)--------------

. Vectors are sequence containers representing arrays that can change in size.

. just like arrays, vectors use contiguous storage locations for teir elements, which means that their elements can also be accessed directly in O(1) time.

. But unlike arrays, their size can chage dynamically, with their storage being gandled automatically by the container.

. Vectors can be used to create dynamic 1D & 2D Arrays.

. Unlike arrays, vectors are passed by value to a function, it may can still pass it by reference if needed.
